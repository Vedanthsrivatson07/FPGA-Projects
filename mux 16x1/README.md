A multiplexer (MUX) is a combinational logic circuit that selects one of several input signals and forwards the selected input to a single output. A 16x1 MUX has 16 input signals and one output signal.

In a 16x1 MUX, there are 16 input lines and one output line. The MUX has four select lines, which are used to determine which input line is selected and forwarded to the output line. The select lines determine the binary code of the input line to be selected.

The 16 input lines are connected to the inputs of 16 AND gates, each with one input connected to one of the select lines. The output of each AND gate is then connected to the input of an OR gate, whose output is the output of the MUX.

The four select lines are decoded by a 4-to-16 decoder, which generates the 16 control signals for the AND gates. The decoder receives the binary code of the input line to be selected from the select lines and activates the corresponding control signal.

The operation of the 16x1 MUX can be summarized as follows:

The binary code of the input line to be selected is provided by the four select lines.
The 4-to-16 decoder generates the 16 control signals for the AND gates.
The control signals activate the corresponding AND gates, which forward the selected input signal to the OR gate.
The OR gate combines the selected input signal with the signals from the other AND gates to produce the output signal of the MUX.
Overall, the 16x1 MUX is a useful circuit that allows a single output to select one of 16 input signals based on the values of the select lines. It is commonly used in digital systems for signal routing, data selection, and address decoding.
