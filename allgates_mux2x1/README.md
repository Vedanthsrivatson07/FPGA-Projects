A 2x1 multiplexer (mux) is a digital logic circuit that selects one of two input signals and forwards it to a single output line, based on the binary value of a single select (or control) line. The control line determines which input signal is selected and passed through to the output.

The circuit contains two inputs labeled I0 and I1, a select line labeled S, and an output line labeled O.

The basic operation of the 2x1 mux can be described as follows:

The binary value of the select line determines which input signal is selected and passed through to the output line.
For example, if the select line is 0 (binary), the mux selects the input signal I0 and forwards it to the output line O. If the select line is 1 (binary), the mux selects the input signal I1 and forwards it to the output line O.
The selected input signal is then routed to the output line, while the unselected input signal is ignored.
The logic diagram for a 2x1 mux consists of two inputs, a select line, and a single output. The select line is connected to a NOT gate, which inverts the binary value of the select line. The input signals are then connected to AND gates, along with the inverted and non-inverted select lines. The outputs of the AND gates are then connected to an OR gate, which selects the input signal based on the binary value of the select line.

Here is an example of a logic diagram for a 2x1 mux:

      | AND|---|     |
S ----|    |   |     |
      +----+   +-----+
In this diagram, the input signals are labeled I0 and I1, the select line is labeled S, the inverted select line is labeled S', and the output line is labeled O.

The circuit contains two AND gates, one OR gate, and one NOT gate. The input signals are connected to the inputs of the AND gates, along with the inverted and non-inverted select lines. The outputs of the AND gates are connected to the inputs of the OR gate, which selects the input signal based on the binary value of the select line. The select line is also connected to the input of the NOT gate, which inverts the binary value of the select line to generate the inverted select line. The output of the NOT gate is connected to the second input of the AND gates.
