An 8x1 multiplexer (mux) is a digital logic circuit that selects one of eight input signals and forwards it to a single output line, based on the binary value of three select (or control) lines. The control lines determine which input signal is selected and passed through to the output.

The circuit contains eight inputs labeled I0 through I7, and three select lines labeled S0, S1, and S2. The output line is labeled O.

The basic operation of the 8x1 mux can be described as follows:

The binary value of the select lines determines which input signal is selected and passed through to the output line.
For example, if the select lines are 000 (binary), the mux selects the input signal I0 and forwards it to the output line O. If the select lines are 001 (binary), the mux selects the input signal I1 and forwards it to the output line O, and so on.
The selected input signal is then routed to the output line, while all other input signals are ignored.
The logic diagram for an 8x1 mux consists of three levels of logic gates: two levels of 4x1 muxes and one level of 2x1 muxes. The 4x1 muxes select one of four input signals based on the binary value of two select lines, while the 2x1 muxes select one of two input signals based on the binary value of one select line.

Here is an example of a logic diagram for an 8x1 mux:

    
In this diagram, the input signals are labeled I0 through I7, and the select lines are labeled S0, S1, and S2. The output line is labeled O.

The 8x1 mux is implemented using three levels of smaller muxes. The first level consists of three 4x1 muxes (M0, M1, and M2), which select one of four input signals based on the value of the two least significant select lines (S0 and S1). The second level consists of three 2x1 muxes (M3, M4, and M5), which select one of two input signals based on the value of the third select line (S2). The
