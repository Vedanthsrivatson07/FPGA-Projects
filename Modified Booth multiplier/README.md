A modified Booth multiplier is a type of digital circuit used to perform fast multiplication of two binary numbers. It is an improved version of the original Booth multiplier algorithm, which uses a technique called partial product reduction to reduce the number of partial products generated during the multiplication process.

The Verilog code for a modified Booth multiplier typically consists of three main modules:

Partial product generator module: This module generates the partial products for each bit of the multiplier and multiplicand. It uses the Booth encoding algorithm to generate the partial products.

Partial product reduction module: This module reduces the number of partial products generated by the partial product generator module. It uses a combination of full adders and half adders to reduce the number of partial products.

Accumulator module: This module accumulates the reduced partial products to produce the final result. It uses a series of full adders to perform the accumulation.
