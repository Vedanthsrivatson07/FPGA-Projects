A JK flip-flop is a type of flip-flop circuit that has two inputs, J (set) and K (reset), and two outputs, Q and Q'. The name "JK" comes from the fact that the flip-flop combines the functionality of the S (set) and R (reset) inputs of an SR flip-flop into two inputs, J and K.

The JK flip-flop has three possible operating modes, determined by the values of its inputs:

When J = 0 and K = 0, the flip-flop maintains its current state, and the output Q and Q' remain unchanged.

When J = 1 and K = 0, the flip-flop is set to the 1 state, so the output Q is 1 and Q' is 0.

When J = 0 and K = 1, the flip-flop is reset to the 0 state, so the output Q is 0 and Q' is 1.

When J = 1 and K = 1, the flip-flop changes its state based on its previous state. If it was in the 0 state, it will be set to the 1 state, and if it was in the 1 state, it will be reset to the 0 state.
