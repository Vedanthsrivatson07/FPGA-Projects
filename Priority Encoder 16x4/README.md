A 16x4 priority encoder is a digital circuit that accepts a 16-bit input and encodes it into a 4-bit output, based on the highest priority active input. The priority encoder generates a binary code that represents the position of the highest priority active input bit.

The 16 inputs are typically labeled from D0 to D15, and the 4-bit output is labeled Y0 to Y3. When multiple inputs are active simultaneously, the priority encoder will encode the highest priority input that is active.

For example, if input D5 and D11 are both active, the priority encoder will encode D11 since it has a higher priority than D5. The output of the priority encoder will be a binary code that represents the position of D11, which would be "1011" in binary or "11" in decimal.

The priority encoder is commonly used in digital systems to convert a set of parallel inputs into a more compact binary code that can be easily processed by downstream logic circuits. It is often used in conjunction with a decoder or multiplexer to implement complex logic functions.


6 to 4 encoder can be constructed by using six 4 to 2 encoders. Four 4 to 2 encoders are connected to the 16 inputs and the 8 outputs are again connected to the two 4 to 2 encoders , which produces 4 outputs.
