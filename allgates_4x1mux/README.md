All gates, also known as universal gates, are logic gates that can be used to implement any Boolean function. In other words, any digital circuit can be designed using only one type of universal gate.

One way to implement all gates using a 4x1 multiplexer (MUX) is as follows:

Connect the inputs of the 4x1 MUX to the four possible combinations of the two input variables.

Connect the selection inputs of the MUX to the two input variables, such that the MUX output corresponds to the desired Boolean function.

Apply the appropriate logic levels to the MUX input and selection lines to implement the desired gate.
