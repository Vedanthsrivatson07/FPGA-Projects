A SR flip-flop is a type of flip-flop circuit that has two stable states, and is used to store a single bit of information. The name "SR" stands for "Set-Reset", which refers to the fact that the flip-flop can be set to a particular state or reset to the other state based on the inputs.

A SR flip-flop has two inputs: S (set) and R (reset), and two outputs: Q (the output) and Q' (the complement of the output).

The truth table for a SR flip-flop is as follows:

When both S and R are 0, the flip-flop maintains its current state, so the outputs Q and Q' remain unchanged.

When S is 0 and R is 1, the flip-flop is reset to the 0 state, so the output Q is 0 and Q' is 1.

When S is 1 and R is 0, the flip-flop is set to the 1 state, so the output Q is 1 and Q' is 0.

When both S and R are 1, the behavior of the flip-flop is undefined or forbidden, as it violates the basic assumption that a flip-flop can only be in one of two stable states at a time. This situation is called a "race condition" and should be avoided.
