A T flip-flop, also known as a toggle flip-flop, is a type of flip-flop circuit that toggles its output state between 0 and 1 on each clock pulse. It has a single input, called the T input, and two outputs, Q and Q'. The T input determines whether the output state toggles or stays the same. When the T input is 0, the output state remains the same, and when the T input is 1, the output state toggles between 0 and 1.

The truth table for a T flip-flop is as follows:

In this table, T represents the input to the flip-flop. Q and Q' represent the two outputs, where Q is the output and Q' is the complement of the output. The state of the flip-flop is determined by the value of T, and the output state is given in the Q and Q' columns. Note that when T is 0, the output state remains the same, and when T is 1, the output state toggles between 0 and 1.
