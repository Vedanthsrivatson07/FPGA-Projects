A digital clock with alarm can be designed using Verilog, which is a hardware description language used for designing digital circuits. The clock and alarm function can be implemented using a combination of registers, counters, and logic gates.

To design a digital clock with alarm using Verilog, the first step is to define the inputs and outputs of the circuit. The clock circuit will have the following inputs and outputs:

Inputs: clock signal, reset signal, alarm enable signal, and alarm time (hours and minutes)
Outputs: current time (hours, minutes, and seconds), alarm signal
The clock circuit can be divided into two main modules: the time module and the alarm module. The time module is responsible for keeping track of the current time and updating the time display, while the alarm module is responsible for generating the alarm signal at the specified time.

The time module can be implemented using a combination of registers and counters to keep track of the current time. The clock signal is used as the input to a counter, which increments on each clock cycle. The counter is then connected to a series of registers, which store the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds. The time module also includes logic gates to display the current time on a digital display.

The alarm module can be implemented using comparators and logic gates to compare the current time with the alarm time and generate the alarm signal. The alarm enable signal is used to enable or disable the alarm function, while the alarm time is stored in registers. The current time is compared to the alarm time using comparators, and the alarm signal is generated when the two times match.
