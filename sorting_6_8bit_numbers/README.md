Sorting 8-bit numbers refers to the process of arranging a list of numbers in ascending or descending order, where each number in the list is represented using 8 bits (or 1 byte) of data.

To sort 8-bit numbers, various algorithms can be used, including:

Bubble sort: This algorithm works by comparing adjacent pairs of elements in the list and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

Insertion sort: This algorithm works by inserting each element in the list into its proper position in a sorted sub-list. The sorted sub-list initially contains the first element of the list, and then each subsequent element is inserted in its correct position.

Selection sort: This algorithm works by selecting the smallest element in the list and swapping it with the first element. Then the second smallest element is selected and swapped with the second element, and so on until the list is sorted.

Merge sort: This algorithm works by recursively dividing the list into smaller sub-lists, sorting each sub-list, and then merging the sorted sub-lists back together.

Quick sort: This algorithm works by selecting a pivot element from the list, partitioning the list into two sub-lists based on the pivot, and then recursively sorting each sub-list.

Overall, the choice of sorting algorithm depends on various factors, such as the size of the list, the distribution of the numbers, and the available computational resources.
