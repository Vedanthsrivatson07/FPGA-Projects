A comparator is a digital circuit that compares two binary numbers and produces a signal indicating whether one number is greater than, equal to, or less than the other.

A 1-bit comparator compares two single-bit binary numbers, A and B, and outputs two signals: "A>B" and "A<B". To implement a 1-bit comparator using 2x1 multiplexers (muxes), we can use the following circuit:
         A     B       A>B     A<B
        |     |        |       |
        |     |        |       |
        |     |        |       |
        |     |        |       |
        |     |        |       |
       \/    \/      \/      \/
      |-----|--------|--------|
      |  1  |  A>B   |  A<B   |
      |-----|--------|--------|

Here, the inputs A and B are connected to the select inputs of the muxes. The outputs of the muxes are connected to the "A>B" and "A<B" signals, respectively. The truth table for this circuit is:
A  B  A>B  A<B
0  0   0    0
0  1   0    1
1  0   1    0
1  1   0    0

A 2-bit comparator compares two 2-bit binary numbers, A = A1A0 and B = B1B0, and outputs three signals: "A>B", "A<B", and "A=B". To implement a 2-bit comparator using 2x1 muxes, we can use the following circuit:
         A1 A0 B1 B0    A>B    A<B    A=B
        |  |  |  |      |      |      |
        |  |  |  |      |      |      |
        |  |  |  |      |      |      |
        |  |  |  |      |      |      |
        |  |  |  |      |      |      |
       \/ \/ \/ \/    \/     \/     \/
      |----|----|----|----|----|----|
      |  1 |  1 |  A>B| A=B| A<B|  0 |
      |----|----|----|----|----|----|

Here, the inputs A1, A0, B1, and B0 are connected to the select inputs of the muxes. The outputs of the muxes are connected to the "A>B", "A<B", and "A=B" signals, respectively. The truth table for this circuit is:
A1 A0 B1 B0 A>B A<B A=B
0  0  0  0  0   0   1
0  0  0  1  0   1   0
0  0  1  0  0   1   0
0  0  1  1  0   1   0
0  1  0  0  1   0   0
0  1  0  1  0   0   0
0  1  1  0  0   0   0
0  1  1  1  0   1   0
1  0  0  0
