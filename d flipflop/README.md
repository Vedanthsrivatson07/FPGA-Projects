A D flip-flop, also known as a data flip-flop, is a type of flip-flop circuit that captures and stores a single data bit. It has a single input, called the D input, and two outputs, Q and Q'. The D input determines the state of the flip-flop on the next clock edge. When the clock signal changes from 0 to 1, the D input is transferred to the output Q.

The truth table for a D flip-flop is as follows:

In this table, D represents the input to the flip-flop. Q and Q' represent the two outputs, where Q is the output and Q' is the complement of the output. The state of the flip-flop is determined by the value of D and the clock signal, and the output state is given in the Q and Q' columns. Note that when D is 0, the output state is 0, and when D is 1, the output state is 1. This behavior is useful for storing data in digital circuits.
