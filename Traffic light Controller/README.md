A traffic light controller is a digital system that controls the operation of traffic lights at an intersection. It can be implemented using a finite state machine (FSM), which is a mathematical model of a system that transitions between a finite number of states based on input and output signals.

There are two types of FSMs that can be used to implement a traffic light controller: Mealy and Moore.

A Mealy FSM outputs a signal based on both the current state and the input signal. In the context of a traffic light controller, the input signals could be the current state of the traffic lights at the intersection, as well as the presence or absence of vehicles or pedestrians waiting to cross the intersection. The output signal would be the control signals that control the traffic lights.

On the other hand, a Moore FSM outputs a signal based only on the current state, and not on the input signal. In the context of a traffic light controller, the current state would represent the state of the traffic lights at the intersection, and the output signal would be the control signals that control the traffic lights.

Both Mealy and Moore FSMs can be used to implement a traffic light controller. However, the Mealy FSM is typically more complex to design and implement, as it requires additional logic to compute the output signals based on both the current state and the input signals. In contrast, the Moore FSM is simpler to design and implement, as the output signals are based solely on the current state of the system.

Regardless of the type of FSM used, a traffic light controller typically includes several states, such as "Green," "Yellow," "Red," and "Flashing," which correspond to the different states of the traffic lights at the intersection. The FSM transitions between these states based on input signals, such as the presence or absence of vehicles or pedestrians waiting to cross the intersection, and generates output signals that control the traffic lights. The goal is to ensure safe and efficient traffic flow through the intersection, while minimizing the risk of accidents and congestion.

In this diagram, the traffic light controller has four states: Red, Red/Yellow, Green, and Yellow. The outputs of the controller are the control signals that control the traffic lights at the intersection.

In the Red state, the controller outputs a signal to turn on the red light and stop traffic in that direction. After 10 seconds, the controller transitions to the Red/Yellow state, where it outputs a signal to turn on both the red and yellow lights, indicating that the light will soon turn green. After 3 seconds, the controller transitions to the Green state, where it outputs a signal to turn on the green light and allow traffic to proceed. After 20 seconds, the controller transitions to the Yellow state, where it outputs a signal to turn on the yellow light, indicating that the light will soon turn red. After 3 seconds, the controller transitions back to the Red state, and the cycle repeats.

Note that this is just an example, and the actual logic diagram for a traffic light controller may be more complex, depending on the specific requirements of the intersection and the traffic flow. Additionally, as mentioned earlier, this example uses a Moore FSM, but a Mealy FSM could also be used to implement a traffic light controller.
